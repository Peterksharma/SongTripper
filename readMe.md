Roadtripper App - Complete Application Overview
🎯 Core Concept
An iPhone app that automatically discovers and queues music from local artists as you drive, creating a unique "musical road trip" experience that connects you to the places you visit.

🏗️ System Architecture
📱 iPhone App (React Native)
       ↕
🌐 Your API Server (Node.js/FastAPI)
       ↕
🗄️ Database (PostgreSQL + Redis Cache)
       ↕
🎵 MusicBrainz API (Artist/Location Data)

📱 iPhone App Features
Core Functions:

Real-time GPS tracking - Monitors location changes while driving
Background processing - Continues working when app is minimized
Music service integration - Connects to Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music
Smart queuing - Adds local artists to your music queue automatically
Driving-safe UI - Large buttons, voice commands, minimal interaction

User Experience Flow:

Setup: User selects preferred music service, grants location permissions
Driving: App detects location changes (new city/area)
Discovery: Finds local artists from that area
Integration: Queues songs into user's active music app
Playback: Music plays seamlessly while driving

Key Screens:

Dashboard: Current location, recently discovered artists, queue status
Settings: Music service preferences, discovery radius, auto-queue settings
History: Places visited, artists discovered, songs played
Now Playing: Integration with active music app


🖥️ Backend API Server
Core Responsibilities:

Location Processing: Convert GPS coordinates to city/region data
Artist Discovery: Query MusicBrainz for artists from specific locations
Data Caching: Store popular cities/artists for fast retrieval
Rate Limiting: Manage MusicBrainz API limits (1 req/second)
Data Enhancement: Clean, filter, and rank artist data

Key Endpoints:
GET /api/artists/by-location?lat=30.267&lng=-97.743&limit=10
GET /api/cities/lookup?lat=30.267&lng=-97.743
POST /api/analytics/track-play
GET /api/user/preferences
Background Jobs:

Cache Warmup: Pre-populate popular cities during off-peak hours
Data Refresh: Update artist data weekly/monthly
Analytics Processing: Track usage patterns, popular routes


🗄️ Database Design
Core Tables:
sqlCities (id, name, state, country, lat, lng, musicbrainz_id)
Artists (id, name, musicbrainz_id, popularity_score, genres)
CityArtists (city_id, artist_id, discovery_count)
UserSessions (user_id, route_data, artists_discovered, timestamp)
Caching Strategy:

Redis Cache: Popular city → artists mappings
TTL: 24 hours for hot data, 7 days for cold data
Cache Warming: Background jobs for top 100 US cities


🎵 Music Service Integration
Phase 1: URL Schemes (MVP)
javascript// Simple deep linking
spotify:search:artist:Local Artist Name
music://search?term=Artist Name (Apple Music)
https://music.youtube.com/search?q=Artist
Phase 2: Native SDKs (Advanced)

Spotify SDK: True queue manipulation, playback control
Apple MusicKit: Direct Apple Music integration
Background Media Session: Lock screen controls

Supported Services:

Spotify (Primary target - largest user base)
Apple Music (iOS native integration)
YouTube Music (Fallback option)
Pandora (Future consideration)


🚗 Driving-Specific Features
Safety First:

Voice Commands: "Play local artists", "Skip to next city"
CarPlay Integration: Native car dashboard integration (Phase 2)
Auto-Queue Mode: Zero interaction required while driving
Large Touch Targets: Easy to tap safely

Location Intelligence:

Smart Triggering: Only discover on significant location changes
Highway Mode: Reduced sensitivity for highway driving
City Detection: Municipal boundaries vs. metro areas
Offline Fallback: Cached data for poor signal areas
